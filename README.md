pc-graphic setting guide for RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2
## PC Video Settings Explained

### Resolution
Resolution determines how many pixels the game renders on your screen.  
Lowering the resolution can significantly increase FPS, especially if you have a weak GPU.  

⚠️ Warning: Lower resolution reduces image clarity and sharpness.

---

### VSync
VSync helps eliminate screen tearing by syncing the game’s FPS with your monitor’s refresh rate.

- **On:** FPS will not exceed your monitor’s refresh rate.
- **Half:** FPS is limited to half of your monitor’s refresh rate.
- **Off:** Unlimited FPS, but screen tearing may occur.

---

### NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency
NVIDIA Reflex is a technology designed to reduce system latency.  
It makes your actions (mouse clicks, keyboard input) register faster in-game.

If you play **Red Dead Online**, enabling NVIDIA Reflex is recommended and does not negatively impact performance.

---

### Triple Buffering
Triple Buffering improves FPS stability when **VSync is enabled**.

### Texture Quality
Texture Quality affects visual detail and VRAM usage.

- **Low:** Lowest visual quality, best FPS, minimal VRAM usage.
- **Medium:** Slightly better visuals, ~2 FPS loss, minimal VRAM increase (~20 MB).
- **High:** Great visual quality, ~1 FPS loss compared to Medium, but ~1 GB higher VRAM usage.
- **Ultra:** Small FPS drop (~5 FPS compared to High) with little noticeable VRAM usage.

📌 **Recommendation:**  
If you don’t have a high-end GPU, **High** is the best balance between visuals and performance. in this Game.
### Anisotropic Filtering
Anisotropic Filtering improves texture sharpness, especially on surfaces viewed at an angle.

Available options:
Off, x2, x4, x8, x16

This setting has very little impact on FPS.  
From Off to x16, the FPS difference is usually around 3 FPS.

📌 Recommendation:  
Based on experience in many games, **x8 or x16** is recommended because it significantly improves texture sharpness with almost no performance cost.

---

### Lighting Quality
Lighting Quality controls the quality and realism of lights, especially noticeable at night.

Available options:
Low, Medium, High, Ultra

- **Low:** Good lighting with the best FPS, but not very realistic.
- **Medium:** Similar FPS to Low, slightly higher VRAM usage, but noticeably better lighting quality.
- **High:** Lighting looks great, but FPS drops around 13 FPS.
- **Ultra:** Best lighting quality in the game, about 5 FPS drop compared to High, very demanding.

⚠️ Warning:  
If your GPU is not strong, **Medium** offers the best balance between performance and visual quality.

---

### Global Illumination
Global Illumination (GI) simulates how light bounces off surfaces, making scenes look more natural and realistic.

Available options:
Low, Medium, High, Ultra

- From **Low to High**, FPS impact is minimal while realism improves a lot.
- **Ultra** causes around 6 FPS drop compared to High, with only minor visual improvement.

📌 Recommendation:  
Use **High** or **Medium** for the best balance.

---

### Shadow Quality
Shadow Quality is one of the most demanding graphics settings.

- **Low:** Poor shadow quality, hard and unrealistic shadows.
- **Medium:** Best balance for most systems.
- **High / Ultra:** Better shadows but very demanding on FPS.

📌 Recommendation:  
Medium is usually the best option unless you have a high-end GPU.

---

### Far Shadow Quality
This option controls shadows for distant objects like trees.

Performance impact is low.

📌 Recommendation:  
Set it to **High** and enjoy the view.

---

### Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
SSAO adds depth by darkening corners and areas where objects are close together, such as:
- Where walls meet the floor
- Under objects
- Around rocks, foliage, and small details

SSAO does not create real shadows, but it greatly improves realism.

In Red Dead Redemption 2:
- Medium to Ultra shows very little visual difference.
- Turning SSAO Off can increase FPS by 6–9 FPS, but makes objects look flat and unrealistic.

📌 Recommendation:  
Keep SSAO **On (Medium)** for better realism.

---

### Reflection Quality
Reflection Quality controls reflections on water, glass, metal, and shiny surfaces.

In Red Dead Redemption 2, this setting has minimal visual impact.

📌 Recommendation:  
Set it to **Medium**.

---

### Mirror Quality
Mirror Quality controls how detailed reflections appear in mirrors.

Mirrors are not very important in RDR2 and have limited use.

📌 Recommendation:  
**Medium** offers the best balance.

---

### Water Quality
Water Quality controls how realistic water looks and behaves.

Red Dead Redemption 2 has some of the best water visuals in any game, but this setting is demanding.

📌 Recommendation:  
Use **Medium** for good visuals and stable performance.
